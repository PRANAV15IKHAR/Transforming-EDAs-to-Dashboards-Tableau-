The DataViz Challenge is a comprehensive data visualization project designed to assess participants' data analysis, dashboard creation, and presentation skills. In this challenge, participants will leverage a dataset of their choice, which they previously analyzed during an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project in Python.

Participants are tasked with designing an interactive and informative Tableau Desktop/Tableau Public/PowerBI Dashboard using the dataset that was used during EDA. The dashboard should effectively convey insights, trends, and key findings from the data, making it accessible and understandable for a diverse audience. Participants should strive for both visual appeal and data-driven decision support.
